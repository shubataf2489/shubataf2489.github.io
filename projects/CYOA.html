            <h1 class="margin text-center"> CYOA Project</h1>
            <p> I made a prject with my partner. I used github and IDE to make this project. This project is about chosing what you want to do in your dream. One of the options is about chosing a pill that gives you powers and the other is getting stuck my lightening to get powers.  </p>
            <p>In more detail In this adventure you will choose what how you want to get you powers in your dream. You can either choose to get a pill or get struck by lighting. Each of theses thing will give you a superpower and later on it will give choices on what you want to do with your power.

First you will be given a choose to either choose superpowers or eat a pill. Both opions will give you powers.

If you choose superpowers you will get hit by lightening and get superspeed. Then you chose what you want to do with your powers. You can either save a grandma from getting it by a car or turn a blind eye and ignore her. If you save the grandma you get hit by a car and if you ignore the grandma you crash into the grandma. After you make you chose it will show you the result of it and then you will wake up.

For the second adventure you will go on, you are put in a situation where you have to choose from two pills one is a red pill one is a yellow pill. If you take the red pill you get the power to read people minds although that gets too overwhelming you can't control it so you die then wake up and realize its a dream. Similar ending for yellow pill except when you take the yellow pill you get to control peoples minds and use that to get your teachers to pass you in all of your classes.</p>

          <p> A challenge I faced was communicating with my partner. We both had different ways we wanted to do the project. So we both sat down and discussed how we wanted to do things, in the end we decided to put both of our ideas together. My partner wanted to write about eat a red/yellow pill and I wanted to do get hit by lightning/drink poison to get powers. In the end we did both. MY teaher wanted us to do this project to get a better grasp og how to use github, solve merge conflicts, communicate with other people and get more comfortable using the IDE. If I had more time I would want to do the extra credit (code my project in HTML)  </p>
