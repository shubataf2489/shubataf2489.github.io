            <h2> context & content </h2>
            <p> During this project I used all of my knowledge on HTML AND CSS to create my webpage. I faced some difficulty along the way but I persevered.</p>
            <p>This project was about how to make a movie webpage. The name of my movie webpage is Al-Ginn. Al-Ginn is about a kid that goes inside a forbidden house. The kid falls for the house's glamorous exterior. Inside the house, he finds a pretty doll.... and you can already guess that this only means something terrible. I mean, when has a seeing doll in an abandoned house ever been a good thing? To know more about the story you are going to have to check out the webpage. One spoiler I can give is that everything in the house is a deception and sometimes beautiful they should only be admired from afar.</p>
         <h2> Reflection: </h2
            <p> Some of the challenges me and my partner faced are, finding bloody fonts and importing them. It took us a long time to even find the fonts we wanted for our webpage. After finding the fonts the only problem was that it wasn't from google fonts and we only learned how to import fonts from Google  Fonts. Since we couldn't find any solutions, we had to change the font and find one that we liked on Google Fonts. 
Another problem we faced was doing the project on time. We thought we had a lot of time but it turned out we didn't. Thankfully we finished in time though. Next time I want to focus on time management. If we had more time we would have made a sequel. </p>
            <p> Some of the resources we used were google(more specifically w3school). This project helped me reveiw all of the skilled I have learned and made me learn more things. Like how to make a a image a click-able link to a youtube video. </p>
                <p> &lt;a href="#">
         img alt="#" src="#"
                width=150" height="70"&gt; </p> 
                    
            <p> This was one of the codes that I focused on the most on in this project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some of the types of the codes we used were: padding, margin,divs,span,headings, img scr, class,id,background-color text-align, color, font-family, and font-size etc...</p>
