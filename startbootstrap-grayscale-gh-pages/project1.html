                <h3>The Future of Aviation: Hydrogen-Powered Planes</h3>
                <p>During my junior year, I worked on a "Freedom Project" for SEP11 that combined my passion for aviation and sustainability. My project was all about exploring the potential of hydrogen-powered planes as a sustainable solution for the aviation industry.</p>

                <h2>Why I Created the Project</h2>
                <p>My goal was to build something that would educate people and spark a conversation about the future of aviation. With the environmental impact of air travel being a growing concern, I wanted to explore how the industry could shift toward sustainability. Hydrogen energy offers a promising solution, and I thought it would be a fascinating topic to dive into.</p>

                <h2>Project Summary</h2>
                <p>The website I created covers the history of aviation, the challenges faced by the industry in terms of sustainability, and how hydrogen-powered planes could significantly reduce aviation's carbon footprint. I also developed an interactive simulation using A-Frame, allowing users to explore the evolution of aviation, from its early days to the potential future of hydrogen-powered flight.</p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>Building the website and simulation wasn’t easy. The integration of the A-Frame simulation presented several challenges. Debugging, fixing issues, and ensuring everything worked together took a lot of time and patience. But in the end, seeing it all come together was incredibly rewarding. I learned the importance of flexibility and persistence, especially when things didn’t go as planned.</p>

                <h2>Skills I Gained</h2>
                <p><strong>Problem-Solving:</strong> From debugging the A-Frame simulation to ensuring everything worked smoothly on the website, I had to think creatively and find solutions.</p>
                <p><strong>Research:</strong> I spent significant time researching hydrogen-powered planes, aviation history, and the environmental impact of flying to develop the educational content for the website.</p>
                <p><strong>Patience:</strong> Learning new coding techniques and fixing issues taught me patience, especially when things weren’t going as expected.</p>
                <p><strong>Web Development:</strong> I gained hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, learning to build a more interactive and engaging website.</p>

                <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
                <p>Through this project, I learned the value of research, iteration, and persistence. When things didn’t work, I had to step back, rethink the approach, and try again. I also realized the importance of understanding the tools I was working with and being patient through the debugging process. The project taught me how to research deeply and experiment until the results were right.</p>

                <h2>Future Plans</h2>
                <p>In the future, I plan to refine the simulation to make it more engaging, possibly by adding better graphics and more data about the potential of hydrogen-powered aviation. I also hope to include more information on the environmental impacts of aviation to help people see the bigger picture. Ultimately, I want to make the website an even more interactive platform that sparks interest in sustainable aviation and hydrogen technology.</p>
